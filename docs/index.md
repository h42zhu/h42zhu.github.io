## The time I enjoyed wasting

Throughout my high school and university years, I enjoyed playing video games. Each game brought me great fun in many unique ways, some were competitive and intellectually challenging, some had deeply touching stories, some were nice distractions that could take one's mind off of stressful school life for a moment.

Sometimes I had ideas popping up in my head about making my own game, but I didn't know anything about making games, so the ideas just stayed as ideas, and were later forgotten.

Later after I'd started working, I felt something was missing. All the activities that were supposed to be fun and memorable -  going to parties, travelling, finding new restaurants, buying different stuffs - were certainly good things to experience, but I felt a vague long of something different, something that can accumulate, something meaningful, something I can call my own.

So I picked up game development. I knew creative endeavors like this were hard. I never set any explicit goals for myself, and I still spent way to time on playing video games than making my game. But as long as I made a little of of progress now and then I'd be satisfied. I wasted a lot of time on trying out different engines and prototyping failed ideas, just like I wasted a lot of time playing times. But that's okay. The time I enjoyed wasting is not wasted.
